**NOTE:** If you want to import NumPy as well as SymPy for whatever reason it is **NECESSARY** that you **import NumPy as np and SymPy as sp, if you skip this I guarantee you will run into conflicts with both.** Both NumPy and SymPy have overlapping function names that do different things, and you will regret skipping over this. This is also good coding practice.
# VSCode Users
Pylance will not allow you to do a wildcard import from SymPy *(Wildcard imports should be avoided and I only did one on SymPy so non-CS students don't have to worry about namespaces)*. If you're using VSCode in the first place you're probably also another CS student, and you should import SymPy as sp, which will make debugging easier just in case something's wrong and like I said, good coding practice.
